Reinforcement Learning Model for Cuphead::

This repository contains my code for our senior project at KSU, where we are building a reinforcement learning model to play the game Cuphead.

The main repo can be found here: 

Object Recognition with YoloV8::

The current implementation includes object recognition using YoloV8, with a starting point for overlap detection. This is an important component of the project as it will enable the agent to identify, locate, and avoid collisions with the game environment. An environment is created using the object recognition and the state is then observed. The positional data being output is the bounding box of the player and slime. 

Training an Agent to Beat the Slime Boss::

Our current goal is to build an environment and train an agent to explore that game environment, so it can beat the slime boss. 

Getting Started::

To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the necessary dependencies, including Python 3.9.0 and Ultralytics. You can install these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided.
